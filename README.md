This is [Jame Hoo's Easy 7-Zip]([rebased on 7-zip's latest release](http://www.e7z.org/)) (Additional Ergonomic & Useful GUI Enhancements and Improvements) , rebased on 7-zip's latest release. This is based on [glachancecmaisonneuve's previous effort of rebasing it on 19.00](https://github.com/glachancecmaisonneuve/Easy7-Zip), though some original features from James Hoo are missing.
